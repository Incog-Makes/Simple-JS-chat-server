# Simple-JS-chat-server

Very basic chat server using javascript, I will be making updates to this, as it's very basic right now and needs some visual/security updates.

Currently it's just using express and socket.io to handle the connection, nothing fancy.


Features:

Pickable usernames

Simple chat window, alongside a server log provided in the console



To Do:

Account creation (permenant usernames/passwords)

UI upgrades so it's not ugly

Better server side management (IP logs, user management, bans, possible admin based privileges etc)


Dependencies:
Node.js

express

socket.io



Installation:

npm install express

npm install socket.io
